# Missing-Confounders-Methods
This is a repository of code for the paper "Assessing treatment effects in observational data with missing confounders: A comparative study of practical doubly-robust and traditional missing data methods" currently underdevelopment as part of the FDA Sentinel Initiative.

The file "Marginal EstimationVignette_20240403.pdf" - demonstrates how to get marginal estimates and confidence intervals for the IPW, generalized raking, and multiple imputation procedures.

Future files will demonstrate the TMLE analysis and provide a link to the paper.
